# LLM-based Knowledge Assistant

**Personal Learning Project**

## Overview

This repository contains a **personal learning project** focused on building a lightweight **LLM-based knowledge assistant** and organizing foundational knowledge related to the **AI field**.

The project explores how large language models can be combined with structured data, custom documents, and retrieval techniques to support question answering and knowledge exploration.
It also serves as a sandbox for applying **core concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and software engineering**.

## Scope of the Project

The project is not intended as a production-ready system.
Instead, it focuses on:

* Understanding **LLM-centered system design**
* Experimenting with **retrieval-based augmentation**
* Practicing clean Python structure and reusable components
* Consolidating AI-related learning materials and experiments

## Key Topics Covered

* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning fundamentals**

  * Model intuition, training workflows, and evaluation concepts
* **LLM & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

  * Document chunking and embeddings
  * Vector-based similarity search
  * LLM-based response generation
* **Python & Software Engineering**

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * Modular code organization
* **Problem-solving foundations**

  * Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) applied in practice

## Experiments & Prototypes

* Initial experiments with **RAG-style pipelines** using custom documents
* Early exploration of **LangChain** to understand:

  * Prompt orchestration
  * Retrieval flow design
* The project is being iteratively extended toward more modular and agent-oriented architectures as learning progresses

## Repository Structure (Relevant Parts)

* `knowledge_base/`
  Contains custom documents and notes used as input data for retrieval-based experiments.
* `initial_rag_pipeline.ipynb`
  A notebook showcasing early experiments with document processing, retrieval, and LLM-based question answering.

> Other directories may reflect ongoing learning, refactoring, or future extensions and are not strictly tied to the initial prototype.

## Technologies

* Python
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning concepts
* LangChain (exploratory usage)
* OpenAI API

## Project Status

This repository represents an **evolving learning project**.
Design decisions, tools, and implementations may change as deeper understanding of LLM systems and AI engineering is developed.

The project is currently being extended toward an **agent-oriented approach**, exploring how LLM-based agents can be orchestrated to support **job information retrieval and analysis** as a practical use case.
